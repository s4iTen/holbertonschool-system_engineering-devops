# One-Server Web Infrastructure Design

To meet the specified requirements, a one-server web infrastructure will be designed to host the website accessible via www.foobar.com. The infrastructure components include:

- 1 server
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 set of application files (code base)
- 1 database (MySQL)
- 1 domain name (foobar.com) configured with a www record pointing to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8)

## User Accessing the Website

1. A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

2. The user enters the URL www.foobar.com in their web browser.

3. The request is sent to the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve the domain name.

4. The DNS identifies the IP address associated with www.foobar.com, which is 8.8.8.8 in this case.

5. The user's computer establishes a connection to the server at IP address 8.8.8.8.

## Infrastructure Specifics

- **Server**: The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure. It provides the necessary hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to run the web server, application server, and database.

- **Domain Name**: The domain name (foobar.com) acts as a human-readable identifier for the website. It allows users to access the website using a memorable name instead of the server's IP address.

- **DNS Record**: The www record in www.foobar.com is a DNS record called a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It points the www subdomain to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), indicating that requests for www.foobar.com should be directed to that IP address.

- **Web Server (Nginx)**: The web server, Nginx, receives incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers. It listens on port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS) and handles the initial processing of the request. Nginx retrieves the requested resources and sends the response back to the user's browser.

- **Application Server**: The application server runs the code base of the website. It processes dynamic content, executes server-side code, and interacts with the database. It communicates with the web server to generate the appropriate response based on the user's request.

- **Database (MySQL)**: The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data. It is used to persist and retrieve information for dynamic content. The application server communicates with the database to perform data operations, such as storing user information, retrieving product details, etc.

- **Server-User Communication**: The server uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol to communicate with the user's computer when serving the website. It establishes a connection over the internet, processes the user's request, and sends the corresponding response containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other assets.

## Infrastructure Issues

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: This infrastructure design has a single server, which can be a potential single point of failure. If the server experiences hardware failure or any other issues, the website will become unavailable.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance**: When performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updating server configurations, the web server needs to be restarted. This can result in temporary downtime and affect the availability of the website during the maintenance window.

3. **Limited Scalability**: With only one server, the infrastructure may face scalability challenges when experiencing a significant increase in incoming traffic. A single server has a limited capacity to handle a large number of concurrent requests, potentially leading to performance

 issues or website slowdowns.

It's important to address these issues by implementing redundancy, load balancing, and scalability measures, such as adding additional servers, implementing fault-tolerant configurations, and utilizing cloud services for scaling resources as needed.
